=== Main ===

parse a program
create a Compiler
store the program in the compiler
create a signature (extractedSignature) and fill it using the program
create another signature (generatedSignature):
  - add each symbol from extractedSignature (replacing types by TYPE_TERM)
  - add booleans (TRUE, FALSE, AND, EQ)
  - add BOTTOM
  - add meta-level constructors (APPL, CONS, NIL, BOTTOMLIST) 
    and ENCODE, DECODE (for tom code only)

[compiler.compileStrategy]
compile a strategy into a list of "untyped" linear rules (ordered or using top-level anti-pattern):
  - before compiling a strategy [r1,...,rn]: remove general anti-patterns

post-treatments:
  - remove top-level anti-patterns
  - expand @
  - option: generate a list of typed rules and a typed generatedSignature


=== CTRS ===
Encode an ordered constructor TRS into TRS

- parse a program
- store the program in the compiler
- create a signature (extractedSignature) and fill it using the program

TRS specific part
- transform the TRS into a linear one (symbols can be added to the generated signature)
- encode the oerderd CTRS
