version 2.8:
  (administrative release)
  - improved the organization of the Tom compiler itself
  - compilation of multiple files in parallel
  - integrate support for AC (Associative-Commutative) matching
  - integrate a new type-inference engine
  - integrate a new tool to connect Tom with EMF
  - several bugfixes

version 2.7:
  - Gom has a new option: --fresh, to generate support for syntax involving
    alpha-convertible names and binding operations
  - Gom has a new option: --nosharing, to generate a data-structure without
    maximal-sharing
  - new traversal combinator in the Strategy Library: Up
  - Java generics in the type preserving visit methods of the Strategy library
  - Gom <--> ATerm has been improved for better compatibility
  - new ant options: ccode and camlcode
  - the Tom compiler is now thread-safe (can compile file in parallel)
  - new option: --multithread

version 2.6:
  - the left-handside of a rule supports the matching-constraint
    notation (p << t), as well as any combination of conjunction (&&) and
    disjunction (||)
  - algebraic rules (lhs -> rhs) can now have any conjunction or disjunction of
    conditions
  - %match and %strategy offer a new notation for simple rules (pattern -> term
    instead of pattern -> { return `term; })
  - the double-dispathing mechanism of the strategy library has been replaced
    by a simpler dispatching approach, making the use of strategies simpler
    when Gom is not used
  - a new tool (GomAntlrAdapter) makes simpler the connection between AST
    produced by Antlr and Gom, making the use of pattern matching and
    strategies directly available on these trees
  - Tom can inline the mapping defined using %typeterm and %op, making the
    generated code smaller and faster
  - Lists generated by Gom implement the Collection interface
  - Term-graph rewriting support in Gom
  - several speed-ups of the compilation process as well as for the
    generated code.

version 2.5:
  - %rule has been replaced by a new rules() construct in Gom. This new
    construct ensures that rules are always applied, even when manipuling a term
    using the Java API.
  - Gom supports various theories for lists. A list can now be normalized wrt.
    associative and neutral element axioms (AU), as well as
    associative-commutative (AC) or AC with neutral element (ACU).
  - Gom supports terms with pointers to manipulate graph structures.
  - Tom has a new compiler based on constraint solving.
  - Tom supports matching for list-operators whose domain is equal to the
    codomain.
    This corresponds to associative matching with neutral element (AU).
    An interesting variant for flattened lists (FL) has also been developed.
  - Tom supports any combination of patterns, anti-patterns, and list-operators,
    even with anti-patterns.
  - The new strategy library sl allows access to more context information, such
    as the root of the term to which the strategy is applied

version 2.4:
  - the eclipse plugin is back, for eclipse version 3.2

  - in the %match construct, the sort of the subject is now optional. Its is
    automatically inferred from the patterns when possible. In addition, a
    subject is no longer restricted to a variable. Constructors and function
    calls can be used.

  - Gom generates congruence strategies and offers new functionalities, such as
    the length of a list.

  - !: a new construct that can be used to denote anti-patterns. Tom support
    anti-patterns under syntactic and list-operators, but not yet in XML.

  - the strategy library has been extended such that strategy expressions can be
    matched, like any other term. A strategy can now take another strategy in
    argument. The mu-expansion is performed on strategies defined using
    %strategy.

  - a support for Java bytecode analysis and transformation has been added

version 2.3:
  - a new generator of abstract data types has been introduced: Gom.
    Its syntax is compatible with the syntax of Vas.
    Gom is more expressive than Vas by allowing the definition of Hooks.
    This ensure that an action is executed each time a constructor is built. In
    practice, this allows to compute canonical forms.
    In addition, Gom generate more compact code and is more efficient than Vas.

  - %strategy: a new construct that helps to defines strategies. When
    using %strategy, it is no longer necessary to define inner-classes.
    In addition, a Tom mapping is automatically generated.

  - %[...]%: a new construct that helps to write backends. The text
    between %[ and ]% is no interpreted, therefore the string
    s=%[print("hello\n")]% corresponds to s="print(\"hello\\n\")"

  - the documentation has been improved. The four documents (reference, guide,
    tutorial, and cookbook) have been merged into one: manual

  - new organization
