Installing TOM
==============

The binary distribution of Tom consists of the following directory layout:

  tom
   +--- bin (BSD Licence)
   |
   +--- lib 
   |     +--- runtime (BSD Licence)
   |     |     +--- shared-objects     // Factory of shared objects
   |     |     +--- jjtraveler         // Visitable interface
   |     |     +--- aterm              // ATerm library
   |     |     +--- tom-runtime        // support for strategies, bytecode, viewer, and xml 
   |     |     +--- Bytecode           // ADT for ASM Bytecode library
   |     |     +--- TNode              // ADT for XML
   |     |
   |     +--- tom (GPL Licence)
   |     |     +--- tom                // Tom compiler
   |     |     +--- gom                // Gom compiler
   |     |     +--- GomADT             // ADT for Gom 
   |     |     +--- TomSignature       // ADT for Tom
   |     |     +--- plugin-platform    // plugin platform
   |     |     +--- PlatformAlert      // platform error messages
   |     |     +--- PlatformOption     // platform options
   |     |
   |     +--- tools (not needed by the runtime, unless you use bytecode, term viewer, or xml supports)
   |     |     +--- ant                // to compile the project
   |     |     +--- ant-antlr          // ant task for antlr
   |     |     +--- antlr-2.7.7        // to compile the Tom parser
   |     |     +--- antlr-3.1.3        // to compile the Gom parser
   |     |     +--- antlr3             // ant plugin 
   |     |     +--- asm-3.0            // to manipulate bytecode
   |     |     +--- grappa1_2          // to visualize terms
   |     |     +--- junit              // to test the system
   |     |     +--- xercesImpl         // for XML
   |     |     +--- xml-apis           // for XML
   |     |     +--- args4j-2.0.10      // for command line parsing
   |     
   +--- share (BSD Licence)
         +--- contrib
         |
         +--- man
         |
         +--- tom 
               +--- adt
               +--- c
               +--- caml
               +--- java


 Only the bin/ and lib/ directories are required to run Tom.
 To install Tom, choose a directory and copy the distribution file there. 
 This directory will be known as TOM_HOME.

Setup
=====
Before you can run Tom there is some additional set up you will need
to do:
  - Add the bin directory to your path.
  - Set the TOM_HOME environment variable to the directory where you
    installed Tom.
  - JDK 1.5 or newer is needed.
    Optionally, set the JAVA_HOME environment variable.
    This should be set to the directory where your JDK is installed.

Windows
-------
We assume that Tom is installed in C:\tom\. 
The following steps are needed for setting up the environment:
  - in the *User Variables* section 
  - set JAVA_HOME to where Java JDK is installed (something like C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_13)
  - set TOM_HOME to C:\tom
  - set CLASSPATH to .;%TOM_HOME%\lib\tom-runtime-full.jar
  - set PATH to %Path%;%TOM_HOME%\bin;%JAVA_HOME%\bin

For a detailed description of setting environment variables in Windows, 
please refer to Windows documentation. For Windows XP, some information 
can be found here :

Unix
----
Assume Tom is installed in ${HOME}/tom. The following sets up the
environment:

(bash)
  export TOM_HOME=${HOME}/tom
  export PATH=${TOM_HOME}/bin:${PATH}
  export CLASSPATH=${TOM_HOME}/lib/tom-runtime-full.jar:${CLASSPATH}

(csh)
  setenv TOM_HOME ${HOME}/tom
  set path=( $TOM_HOME/bin $path )
  setenv CLASSPATH ${TOM_HOME}/lib/tom-runtime-full.jar:${CLASSPATH}
