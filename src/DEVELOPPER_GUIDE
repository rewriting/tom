Tom Developper Guide
--------------------

This file explains how the compiler works and should help to understand in
which part of the compiler particular treatment is done

* Compiler plugins
------------------
The compiler is composed of several plugins, which are executed in the following order:
- Starter
  initialize the platform and run the others plugins

- Parser
  parse the input file
  call gom

- Syntax Checker
  verify some syntactic properties an raise an error message when an error is
  detected

- Desugarer
  update the SymbolTable. For each symbol:
    add default IsFsym and default Make to symbols
    replaces 'TermAppl' by its 'RecordAppl' form
    replaces 'XMLAppl' by its 'RecordAppl' form
  transforms the input term:
    replaces  _  by a fresh variable _* by a fresh varstar 
    replaces 'TermAppl' by its 'RecordAppl' form
    replaces 'XMLAppl' by its 'RecordAppl' form
    replaces 'BQRecordAppl' by its 'BQAppl' form

- Transformer

- Typer
  update the SymbolTable. For each symbol and for the input term:
    typeVariable:
      replace a TomType(_,EmptyTargetLanguageType()) by its expanded form (TomType)
      perform type-inference
    propagateVariablesTypes: in all constraints, if a variable has a type, this
     type is propaged to all the variables of the constraint
    replaces 'abc' by concString('a','b','c')
    TransformBQApp: after typing, transform each BackQuoteTerm into its
     compiled form (BuildConstant, BuildList, FunctionCall, BuildTerm)

  * The typer is explained in chapter 4 of Claudia Tavares' thesis. However,
   some optimization was done during implementation in order to reduce the
   number of fresh type variables generated. Here we give a brief list of main
   differences:

    1) the fresh type variable counter is set in function of the result of
    "updateSymbolTableNewTyper" method in TyperPlugin and also of
    "collectKnownTypesFromCode" method in NewKernelTyper. This is done to avoid
    same type variables used to type different terms when bootstrapping (due to threads).

    2) methods 'addEqConstraint' and 'addSubConstraint' adds a constraint c in a
    constraint set C if both types t1 and t2 in c are different from
    'EmptyType()' AND if t1 is different from t2. In this case, the rule
        type = type, err, sigma => err, sigma
    of constraint resolution (Section 3.3.5) is not
    necessary anymore. Correspondingly, the rule
        {type <: type} U C', sigma => C', err, sigma
    of constraint resolution (Section 4.3.4.1) is not necessary anymore;

    3) method 'inferConstraint' tries to get the type of operators in SymbolTable before to generate
    type variables. A fresh type variable is generated only if the operator is
    not in SymbolTable;

    4) strategy 'inferTypes' for 'visit TomTerm' and 'visit BQTerm'. In these
    cases, variables do not add a constraint 
        C = {tvar_in_varPatternList = tvar_of_contextType} U C
    as in the thesis, but instead
        C = {tvar_in_varPatternList <: tvar_of_contextType} U C

    Correspondingly, functions and lists do not add a constraint
        C = {codomain_in_SymbolTable = tvar_of_contextType} U C
    as in the thesis, but instead
        C = {codomain_in_SymbolTable <: tvar_of_contextType} U C;

    5) methods 'inferSlotList' and 'inferBQTermList' responsible for type
    inference of arguments of functions and lists try to get the type of
    domain of operators in SymbolTable before to generate type variables. Then
    the strategy 'inferTypes' is called with contextType set to the ground type
    of domain and no constraints are added in C.

    The exact implementation of the typer described in chapter 4 of Claudia's
    thesis (without optimization) can be found in:
    work >> claudia >> thesis >> codes >> typer-versions >> TypingWithSubtypes.t

- Type checker
  traverse the AST and check that variable that appear more than once in the
  LHS have coherent types
  Also check that VariableStar appear under a compatible list symbol 
  Check that visit <type> constructs have a known <type> 

- Expander
  compiles %strategy
    generate instrospectors if -gi is activated
    generate visitLight and visit

- Compiler
  ACPropagator: transform to compile AC matching
  - remove a term which is not a VariableStar
  - use abstraction to compile  
  - use abstraction to compile non-linear variables
  - transform AC matching into A matching when the pattern is reduced to 
    an empty-list or a single variable



- Optimizer

- Backend




* AC Matching
-------------
The compilation of AC Matching is done in a simple way. The complex pattern is
transformed into a conjunction of simpler patterns (possibility associative
patterns instead of associative-commutative patterns). The terminal case is
implemented by an AC pattern which has the following form: f_AC(X*,Y*) << t

The transformation of AC patterns into simpler AC patterns and A patterns is
performed in compiler/propagator/ACPropagator.t

The generation of auxillary functions (getMultiplicities, etc.) is done in
compiler/Compiler.t

* Inlining
----------
This option improves the quality of the generated code by eliminating auxillary
functions that come from the mapping definition. The body of these functions is
directly inlined in the code that corresponds to the compilation of pattern
matching.

The implementation of Inlining is quite tricky because it should also be
compatible with mapping which are not inlining-compatible (i.e. which do not
use the $ sign to identify variables)

In backend/TomBackend.t, a mark phase traverses the AST to mark all the mapping
declaration which are used. In the same time, the mapping definition are
insterted in the SymbolTable.
This table will be later used in TomGenericGenerator and TomCFamillyGenerator
to retrieve the template associated to a given construct (call to getIsFsym for instance).
The template is used by the method instantiateTemplate to know whether some
code (its instance) has to be generated, whether a call to the function ha to
be generated (i.e. non inlining).

The Declaration are also inserted in the SymbolTable during this phase.
When a SymbolDecl is encounter, the Symbol is extracted from the SymbolTable
and its fields (i.e. the Declaration) are traversed again to be inserted into
the mapInliner.


* How the platform is run
  starting point:  Tom.java.in
  PluginPlatformFactory.getInstance().extractConfigFileName(args);
  new ConfigurationManager(configFileName);
    - parse Gom term
    - create plugins
    - create option manager (using reflexivity)
    - collect global options
    - initialize option manager
  [Tom]OptionManager:
    - collect options (including itself)
    - processArguments
    - store values of each options
    - store relation Option <--> OptionOwner
    - call optionChanged when an option is set

PluginPlatformFactory 
    - create a platform
    - manage a pool of platforms
    *** create a new ConfigurationManager. WHY ?

PluginPlatform extends PluginPlatformBase:
    - get list of input files
    - run the list of plugins
    *** TODO: build a sequence of plugins, interpret this sequence
